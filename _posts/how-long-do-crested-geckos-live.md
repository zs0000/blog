When I first found out how long Crested Geckos lived in as pets in captivity, I was SHOCKED! They don't quite compare to some of the A Torotise, but they've earned my respect. In this article we'll be going over everything from what we know about how long Crested Geckos live in the wild, to how long they live in captivity, and even things like what contributes to a longer living animal, and even Crested Geckos Lifespan compared to Other Reptiles - such as a Leopard gecko, Ball Python, Bearded Dragon and more!

Unfortunately because of so much conflicting information we will not say any of the following is fact: 
however its suggested that they may live around 4-5 years, with most Crested Geckos dying in their first 
year of living. This is speculated for many reasons - some of the main would be the Larger Rhacodactylus that they share the forest with, declining population numbers that at one point had humans thinking the Crested Gecko was exctinct, disease, and inconisistent food sources.
<br/>
<br/>
Most of what we read doesn't sound far-fetched, however, we think there is room for more information. It's a 
miracle to us that reptiles like the Crested Gecko can do things like dig a hole in the forest floor, lay the eggs, and they have the chance to hatch - as some breeders have issues with too low or too high of humidity in controlled environments with products like ReptiHatch that increase chances of success. Take the information with a grain of salt, and feel free to email us or direct message us any new information!

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">How Long Do Crested Geckos Live? Lifespan as Pet</h2>

Crested Geckos can live over 20 years in captivity as pets! It's more common for a Crested Gecko to live anywhere from 12-16 years, but there is rare reports online that people have Cresteds that have reached over 20 years!
<br/>
<br/>
In captivity, Crested Geckos live a much more comfortable life since the stress of being hunted,
and having to hunt - is non-existant!
We'll cover why Crested Geckos are able to live so much longer as pets, compared to in the wild, in <a href="#how-can-i-make-my-crested-gecko-live-longer" className="underline font-bold">the next section.</a>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Things to Factor in Crested Gecko Lifespan</h2>

Constant or consistent stress on your animal could contribute to a shorter lifespan for your Crested Gecko. This stress could be caused many different ways, a few common ways are constant or stressful handeling, improper nutrients and or improper diet, and Cohabbing. Other stress factors could include temperature, humidity, visual barriers, proper lighting schedule, etc.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Crested Gecko Lifespan Compared to Other Reptiles</h2>

As a fun comparison, we've compared the lifespan of a Crested Gecko to the lifespan of a Ball python, Bearded Dragon, and Leopard Gecko - three of the most beginner popluar pet reptiles. 
<br/>
<br/>
When compared to A Ball Python, Crested Geckos no longer seem spectacular from a length of lifespan standpoint - as Ball Pythons could live 
over 30 years! Even though the sticky toed lizard loses to its scaley squirmy friend, it still performs well versus the other two reptiles!
<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately for the New Caledonian Gecko, when compared to a Leopard Gecko, the Crested Gecko barely comes out on top! Leopared Geckos have an average lifespan of 15 years, compared the the Crested Geckos 20 year average. Both still make amazing pets!
<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, Bearded Dragons live an average of 10-15 years, so the Crested Gecko comes out 'victorious' in this comparison as well. I didn't know how long Beared Dragons lived prior to writing this article, so I was a little shocked to learn.
<br/>
<br/>
The Crested Gecko lives longer than 2 out of 3 of the most popular beginner pet reptiles. Obviously animals and their living conditions aren't black and white, so it's not guarenteed this will always be the case. However on an average basis, it should be the case.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Article Recap</h2>

We don't know as much as we want when it comes to the lifespan of a Crested Gecko in the wild. It's hard to gauge how long they live in the wild for many reasons. The two main reasons is where they live (A French group of islands, called New Caledonia), and how elusive they are. Their population is also declining at exceeding rates in the wild. Thankfully it's increasing in captivity, so the Crested Gecko shouldn't be going anywhere anytime soon!
<br/>
<br/>
As a pet, keeping your Crested Gecko alive should be quite simple, provided your do your research. We will always be here to help you learn and advance your husbandry and care for your Crested Gecko keeping skills. In captivity, with good care, Crested Geckos should live for around 20 years, plus or minus a few years.
<br/>
<br/>
If lifespan is your deciding factor because you love reptiles and you want one that will live decently long, than the Crested Gecko is a great pick. We did find out the Ball python beats it out by an average of 10 years! But when compared with the other two most popular beginner reptiles - the Bearded Dragon and the Leopard Gecko, the Crested beats both of them by an average of 5-10 years!
