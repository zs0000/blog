Choosing a home for your new, and potentially first pet Crested Gecko is one of the most exciting parts of the process. This is where you get to be creative, while providing an enclosure that both fits your reptiles needs, aswell as looks stunning. Our goal with this post is to provide you, a New Crested Gecko Keeper, with all you need to know about choosing the right home, while making sure your animal is safe, happy, and healthy.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">How Big Should A Crested Geckos Enclousure Be?</h2>

There are a couple of factors to take into account when determining what size tank your pet Crested Gecko will need. To keep things simple, the main thing we will be paying attention to is weight. This is a better gauge of stage in growth, as some Crested Geckos won't grow as fast as others.
<br/>                           
Determining growth stage using weight as the primary factor, will allow you to make easier judgement calls whether a Crested Gecko is ready, 
to move up in enclosure size, or not. In this Article we will be breaking it Up into 3 life stages that we will determine using weight - 
and you can use that information to choose the best fit for your little sticky-toed lizard friend!

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">What Size Enclosure Does a Hatchling or Baby Crested Gecko Need?</h2>

There is a variety of different homes you can use to house a hatchling (1-6 grams approx.). If you're a beginner to the hobby or keeping a pet we reccomend starting with a juvenile or Adult Crested Gecko, however, a hatchling is fine as well; you'll just have to monitor eating habits and weight. 
<br/>
<br/>
For beginners we reccomend using a Exo-terra Mini (12x12x12) or another enclosure with similar dimensions. It's not the only home that will work, but using something that has pre-built airflow, with good ventilation, will make it easier on you as a first time Crested Gecko pet owner. As you probably know by now, Crested geckos need a certain humidity range (with dry out periods at some point in the day) and using a prebuilt enclosure like the Exo Terra Mini will help you sustain good humidity levels, while still allowing enough air to dry out the enclosure.  We recommend keeping your pet reptile in this home until around 6-10g before moving to a larger enclosure like the (12x12x18). 
<br/>
<br/>
If this isn't your first Crested Gecko and want to save money while still providing a great home for your reptile, Shoe Box tubs, or an Acrylic equivalent, can be modified to to create sufficient airflow, ultimately creating a budget home. When taking this approach, caution is advised on drilling to large of holes, too many holes, not enough holes, etc. Guides can be found online for reference on what a home made enclosure might look like. It is advised in the hobby to use any where between 6-10 qt containers for Crested Geckos in the Hatchling or Baby life stage. We recommend keeping your pet reptile in this home until around 6-10g before moving to a larger enclosure like the (12x12x18).
 <span id="what-size-enclosure-does-a-juvenile-need"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">What Size Enclosure Does a Juvenile Crested Gecko Need?</h2>

Juvenile Crested Geckos should have a 12x12x18 Enclosure, or 20 Gal Vertical equivalant. For the sake of this article, the weight range acceptable for 12x12x18 / Vertical 20 gals, will be (7 - 25 grams). 
Some Crested Gecko owners will keep their Crested Geckos in a smaller enclosure like a 8-12 qt until weights like 12-15 grams, to ensure healthy transition. This isn't necessary per say, however is a safe 
option as well. The worry is that in a bigger enclosure, finding food might be harder.
<br/>
In our experience as Crested Gecko Keepers, we haven't had an issue with transferring hatchlings from shoe box (6qt sterlite containers) to 12x12x18 sterlite containers (30qt sterlite tub). One thing to keep in mind is Crested Geckos might undergo a brief 1-3 day no eating period, and sometimes even eat lightly for up to 2 weeks after undergoing a transition between enclosures, but this is easily prevented by leaving the animal alone and not handling for atleast 1-2 weeks, and supplementing diet with Live Feeder Insects <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="/posts/what-do-crested-geckos-eat#what-insects-can-i-feed-my-crested-gecko">(Insects Crested Geckos Can Eat</a> - to find out what insects to feed your Pet Crested Gecko)
<span id="what-size-enclosure-does-a-adult-need"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;"> What Size Enclosure Does An Adult Crested Gecko Need?</h2>

Adult Crested Geckos should have a minimum of 12x12x18 or Vertical 20 gal equivalent, and can be housed in enclosures as large as 18x18x38 or a 56qt sterlite container equivalent. At this size, finding food will almost never been an issue. It's always good to gauge your animal, as bigger isn't always better. Some Crested Geckos we keep, do better in 12x12x18 than the bigger enclosures - which we suspect is because that particular animal get stressed out with that much space or territory. 
<br/>
<br/>
It's hard to gauge whether or not your animal utilizes all of its space if you aren't awake late at night, due to their nocturnal nature. However we have found most of our animals will explore all of their enclosure on almost a nightly basis. We have some breeding females in 18x18x36 by themselves doing great. It ultimately comes down to knowing your animal, providing a sufficient amount of space, but also providing visual barriers, vines, and or cork bark to fill the extra space.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">DIY Crested Gecko Enclosures: Building On a Budget</h2>

Providing your pet Crested Gecko with a spacious enclosure doesn't have to be expensive. DIY builds are actually quite common in the reptile hobby. Its a great option for keepers who are experienced at monitoring humidity levels and animal health. The concept is to create living spaces equivalent in size (or greater) to premade terrariums similar to ones provided by Exo-terra or Zoo Med - Or for hatchling Crested Geckos, people typically use 6-10qt Sterlite containers.
<br/>
<br/>
We've built our Budget DIY Crested Gecko enclosures from mostly Sterlite containers, it doesn't have to be that brand, we've just found it easier to find equivalent measurements in tubs with that brand than others.
A great example is the 28qt containers - which measurements are just 12x12x18 (Sound familiar?) with strong latching tops, and only cost us $9 a piece at a local Hardware store. 
<br/>
<br/>
All that needs to be done is ventilation (and plant furnishing ofcourse). Some people use 1/3rd or 1/4th in drill bits and drill holes around the parameter of the conatiner. Another method is to cut, melt, or drill a section out that you can glue/place some kind of mesh or screen over. Either method works perfectly fine. We reccomend building a test enclosure before placing an animal in it to live, and testing the humidity with normal mistings. This is to ensure the enclosure has enough ventilation, or to see if it is too much ventilation.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">What's the Best Crested Gecko Enclosure Brand?</h2>

There isn't one particular brand that is considered "the best", however there are many quality terrarium providers like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/exoterra/?hl=en" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Exo Terra</a>, <a className="underline font-bold" href="https://www.instagram.com/zoomedlabs/?hl=en">Zoo Med</a>, Zilla, Thrive, etc. A Glass enclosure from any of those prebuilt brands will do great for your pet Crested Gecko.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as recommendations go, we recommend you list your deciding factors and weigh the benefits of each decision. Some deciding factors could be 'what size enclosure do I need', 'Do I want Single or Double Doors', 'Am I going to use UVB lighting?'. Understanding your needs will make it very simple to decide, and you can't go wrong with any of those brands as beginner, or seasoned keeper.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;"> What Size Enclosure Do I Need For 2 Adult Crested Geckos?</h2>

This is never a recommended practice. Crested Geckos are not meant to be Cohabbed (multiple geckos living in one terrarium) unless for breeding purposes, and even in this case many breeders only keep their Crested Geckos together for 1-3 weeks during breeding season. Some large scale breeders such as AcReptiles claim you can keep Breeding pairs Cohabbed year round, however this is not recommended as your Crested Geckos can drop weight very quickly, drop their tails, lose crests, and sustain many other injuries - so this is only for more experienced breeders to experiement with.
<br/>
<br/>                            
This is not to say it's not possible to breed Crested Geckos without one being injured, but it should be saved for the seasoned, more knowledgeable keepers. Some Pet stores do a disservice to the reptile community and the crested gecko keeping hobby by cohabbing the animals in the sale/display tanks, which commonly leads to newer owners believing that this is normal behavior - but it will lower the success rate of raising young, healthy hatchling Crested Geckos, and they could lose a limb, toe, or tail, so we always recommend against this.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;"> What Size Enclosure Do I Need For 2 Adult Crested Geckos?</h2>

Deciding what to buy to house your pretty, Eyelash Gecko, is very easy when you understand two things - 'How much does my animal way', 'Does my animal utilize it's space'. The Second question can be harder to answer, so weight can be used in the event you are unsure. Crested Geckos grow at varying rates so it wouldn't be benefical to establish a time guide like 'at 6 months', 'at 1 year'. Typically Crested Geckos are broken into three major life stages - Hatchling, Juvenile, and Adult, (sometimes sub-adult before adult) - and using these three life stages to guide your housing choice makes it easier than ever.
<br/>
<br/>
For more experienced Breeders and Keepers, DIY enclosures can be made on a budget, which can help manage costs for any size collection - small or large! Remember to test Ventilation to ensure it's not to little or too much!
<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, Crested Geckos should never be cohabbed besides for breeding purposes. Two male Crested Geckos SHOULD NEVER BE COHABBED EVEN DURING BREEDING SEASON (large group of 2 males, 2 females) they will fight and one of them will get hurt.
