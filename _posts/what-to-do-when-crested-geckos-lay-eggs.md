Whether you're wondering about breeding, or just found your first set of unexpected eggs - we believe it should be an eggciting and fun process. Many newer reptile breeders will feel overwhelmed, but we're going to explain in detail everything from how many eggs Crested Geckos lay each time, to what to incubate your eggs in, to how long it takes to hatch! After this quick read, breeders will be well equipt with the knowledge they need to do every thing start to finish, in the crested gecko breeding process.

<span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12px;text-align:center;">(if you are unsure whether they are fertile read <a href="#how-to-tell-if-a-crested-gecko-egg-is-fertile" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">'How To Tell If An Egg is Fertile'</a>)</span><br/>

Upon finding a single, or set of Fertile Crested Gecko eggs the first thing you are going to do is set-up your incubation medium, and container for incubating. There is a variety of options to use for both the incubation medium, and the container used, however we reccomend using products made for this purpose - such as <a href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/hatchrite.html" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">HatchRite</a>, or <a href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/pangea-hatch.html" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Pangea Hatch</a>, and as far as the container something like <a href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/reptile-egg-organizer.html" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Pangea Hatchbox</a>, or a similar product would work. The most important thing when choosing the container is not having too much or too little air flow, as this could cause complications with the eggs, like mold, "drowned" eggs, or eggs that dry out. The incubation mediums we have now are quite amazing and make it super easy to tell if you need more substrate or moisture. If you're a beginner, we recommend staying away from something like vermiculite unless you've used it with other reptiles or feel confident in your knowledge. Vermiculite is completely fine to use, however from what we've seen - retains very high amounts of moisture - making it more likely to mold, thus being more difficult that something like Hatchrite.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">What Is Incubation Medium/Substrate?</h2>

Incubation Medium is the substrate in which Crested Gecko Eggs are incubated. Commonly used substrates are <a href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/hatchrite.html" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">HatchRite</a>, or <a href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/pangea-hatch.html" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Pangea Hatch</a>, Vermiculite, sphagnum moss, etc. The role the medium plays in the Crested Gecko Incubation process is vital. The medium ensures the eggs stay hydrated, without overhydrating the eggs, or drying out in a short period of time. Substrates that aren't as poreous or that dry out quicker will not be as useful in fufilling the needs of the eggs. Thankfully, it's super simple to prepare a hatch box and the incubation medium - as some of the products come premade and moisturized, and others only need a quick rinse, soak, and drain before they're ready to go! Pangea Hatch can even be boiled and reused according to their website! Products like Pangea Hatch, along with premade containers, makes setting up the substrate for your eggs is very easy and headache free!

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">How To Tell If A Crested Gecko Egg Is Fertile?</h2>

A common practice to find out if Crested Gecko eggs are fertile is by using a pen light, or cell-phone flashlight, held under the egg. Breeders do this in search of what they call the "Red Cheerio" which is the embryo inside of the egg that signifies whether an crested gecko egg is fertile or not. With your egg horizontal, the "Red Cheerio" should be at the top of the egg (not vertical). If you don't see it, you may spin the egg slightly to see if you can find the it. A safe practice if you are still unsure is to treat each egg like it is fertile, and set up incubation substrate, and incubate the eggs. Best case scenario they grow over the course of the next 2-4 months - signifying fertility. Worst case scenario they go bad in a few weeks and you can throw them out. We always recommend assuming they're fertile as it may not always obvious, or easily determined whether the eggs are fertile or not. <a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uXZ3FMan9C0/UT0qdlme0iI/AAAAAAAAAqE/EXI_KhfJkvU/w644-h428-o-k/001%2B%25281%2529.JPG" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Here</a> is an example of an egg that had a very, very slight "Red Cheerio" on the first day the breeder found it, and <a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-crtYJ19yTvE/UT0qm6pkD2I/AAAAAAAAAqM/qTkRO-0yXN4/w760-h428-o-k/100MEDIA%2524IMAG0678.jpg" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">here</a> is that same egg three days into incubation - showing much more apparent signs of fertility, with a much bolder "cheerio".

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">What Temperature Should I Incubate Crested Gecko Eggs At?</h2>

There are a few factors in choosing what temperature you're going to want to incubate your eggs at. The main thing we'll be focusing on it size/weight of your hatchlings at time of hatch. The common temperature range for Crested Gecko Incubation is anywhere from 68-75 degrees fahrenheit, we recommend staying on the lower end. Keeping temperatures lower will increase hatch rate success, and lead to longer incubation periods, ultimately resulting in larger hatchling crested geckos. Typically they have around 1-3 grams in weight, and if you can get in the 2 gram range you'll have a much better start with your fresh hatchling. This is why we recommend an incubation temperature of 68-72 degrees fahrenheit.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">How Long Does It Take For A Crested Gecko Egg To Hatch?</h2>

Crested Gecko eggs hatch at varying rates, largely dependant on your incubation temperature. As recommended in <a style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;" href="#what-temperature-should-i-incubate-crested-gecko-eggs-at">"What Temperature Should I Incubate Crested Gecko Eggs At?"</a> an incubation temperature of 68-72 degrees fahrenheit is what we'd go with. This will increase your incubation time to around 90-120 days, but will result in a much healthier, larger, baby gecko. Hypothetically, on the flip side, if you incubated crested gecko eggs at 75 degrees consistently, the eggs would hatch in around 60-80 days. This isn't recommended unless you don't have a choice in the matter. Hatchling Crested Geckos are very sensitive and it would be very helpful to have larger, healthier hatchlings to begin with. Other factors that might affect size and weight at birth is genetics, mothers nutrition at time of production, etc.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Article Recap</h2>

Finding a fresh clutch of eggs from one of your crested gecko pairs can be so exciting! It can also be stressful to new breeders and keepers if they aren't familiar with the process. Our goal is to make it simple, easy, and restore that EGGcitement that every breeder should have. Incubation is easier now than it ever has been thanks to revolutionary products like HatchRite, an incubation medium made pre-moisturized, and Pangea Hatch, an affordable, reusuable product! All you need now is a Incubation container with proper air flow, ensuring there is enough that mold wont grow, but not too much that the substrate will dry out, as the eggs need to remain hydrated. Lastly, a temperature controlled environment within the ranges 68-75 degrees is acceptable, however we recommend temperatures of 68-72, as this will lead to longer incubation periods of 90-120 days, resulting in larger, healthier hatchlings.
