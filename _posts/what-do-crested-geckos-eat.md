Many of the popular diets fed to pet Crested Geckos today were inspired by findings about thier diet in their natural habitat, New Caledonia.
In the past, people fed them fruit mixtures, comprised of mainly Bananas or Mangos. Since then, it's been discovered by fecal tests that Crested Geckos ate much more than fruit - 
so breeders and keepers have adjusted accordingly, and introduced a well-balanced diet.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">What Do Crested Geckos Eat in The Wild?</h2>

In the wild, Crested Geckos have an abundance of choices for food, and they don't take that for granted, partaking in a little of everything - primarily still fruit. Through fecal tests, researchers have found out that the sticky-footed gecko 
eats much more than just Bananas or Mangos. The most notable finding was the content of insects of insect protein, as people suspected the Crested Gecko was strictly a 
frugivore, not an omnivore. Many of these insects were likely a type of beetle, or roach - as New Caledonia is ripe with many different beetle and roach species (ex: Celatoblatta) and these insects are typically found on the forest floor or lower parts of the tree, which is typically where you'd find Crested Gecko in the wild.  a Another interesting findning thats been adopted by some, was the presence of plant and flower pollens. Since these findings, popular Meal Replacement Powders like <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="https://www.pangeareptile.com">Pangea Crested Gecko Food</a>, or <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="https://www.pangeareptile.com">Respashy Meal Replacement Powder</a>, have released 
a variety of powered diets, some of which are supplemented with insects, which we will discuss in the next section.

It's normal if you feel over-whelmed when learning about care for keeping new pets,
like a Crested Gecko. However, these creatures are very hardy and simple to take care of, especially thanks to popular Meal Replacement Diets like <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="https://www.pangeareptile.com">Pangea Crested Gecko Food</a>, or <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="https://www.pangeareptile.com">Repashy Meal Replacement Powder</a>. 
Any well-known food brand will do, as there is many others such as Clarks, Big Fat Gecko Smoothie, BP Zoological, etc. These are all acceptable, and there is actually advantages in certian aspects of using each one of those diets.
We will cover the topic of Powder compositions and how it affects calcium levels, color expression, and more - in a future post. These diets can be found on their respective sites

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">What Insects Can I Feed My Crested Gecko</h2>

When it comes to feeding your pet Crested Gecko, they aren't much different than other geckos in terms of insects they can have, however there is a few exceptions.
We'll start off with the insects they can have, and later discuss some of the findings that discourage the feeding of other bugs. The most commonly fed bugs are 
Crickets, Dubia Roaches, Discoids , and Black Soldier Fly Larvae. According to an article written by <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="https://www.dubiaroaches.com">DubiaRoaches.com</a> had features a graphic that broke down percentage or protein, fat, and other data between the most popular feeding insects which can be found <a href="https://dubiaroaches.com/blogs/feeder-insects/dubia-roaches-vs-common-feeder-insects" style="text-decoration:underline;">here</a>.
<br/><br/>
Dubia Roaches are the highest scoring out of the 10 tested feeder insects, when taking into account levels of Protein - 23.4%, Fat - 7.2%, and exceptional levels of calcium while maintaining low phosphorus. This is important as high levels of phosphorus 
can cause calcium absorbption to be blocked, and brittling of the bones over time. To Solve this problem from naturally occuring, Breeders and keepers have habitualized dusting their bugs before feeding - which is covered in the next section.
<br/><br/>
If Dubia Roaches are illegal in your state (ex: Florida) Discoids are a great alternative for that issue. Discoids will stil beat Crickets in terms of fat, will be on par with protein, and supply more calcium with lower phosphorus levels to your animal. This isn't to say crickets are an issue, or bad to feed. Crickets are a great options as well.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">How Often Should I Feed A Crested Gecko</h2>

The answer varies for both meal replacement powders and insects. Though it was discovered Crested Geckos also eat insects, Meal replacement mixtures/fruit powder mixtures are reccomended primary nutrition and feeding source for your geckos, with insect being an extra, 
supplemental staple in their diet. Feeding and replacing the old formula can be done every 1-2 days, and calcium dusted insects should be fed 1-2 times a week, alternating between supplmentation of D3, and none. More on this will be covered in the next section.
<br/>
<br/>
It's not uncommon for a keeper to not supplment insects on a regular basis, however we reccomend supplementing calcium dusted insects 1-2 times a week, or once a month at the very least. Insects have extra nutrtition such as
extra fats and proteins that can be very helpful in the growth and maintence of your Crested Gecko.
<span id="dusting-insects"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">What Does 'Dusting Insects' Mean?</h2>

The term 'dusting insects' refers to putting a light coat of powder onto the insects you're going to feed to your pet reptile. Typically this powder consists of a calcium powder, sometimes inlcuding vitamin D3. This helps to avoid unhealthy conditions like MBD (Metabolic Bone Disease) which is a common condition that develops when an animal doesn't get the calcium and nutrients it needs. MBD leads to malformation of bone development, and should be avoided at all costs.
<br/>
<br/>
When dusting bugs with calcium and vitamin D3 you want to make sure you don't over supplement the D3. Over Supplmentation can be avoided by alternating D3 with each feeding. Some calciums come with D3 in the mix, which is okay to use as long as you have an alternative that is only calcium to allow you to alternate between feedings.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Do Crested Geckos Need A Water Bowl?</h2>

It used to be believed that reptiles, more specifically, Crested Gecko's wouldn't drink from a water bowl because they lack the ability to sense or detect water without it being in motion, like a river, or stream.
This concept has been disproven since then, and breeders and keepers have started leaving water bowls in their enclosures. It is reccomended to not leave a dish that is too deep, or slick for your pet to get out of. 
We also reccomend replacing the water, and water bowl, every 1-2 days.
<br/>
<br/>
Some keepers rely only on the mistings done 1-2 times a day, typically at night. This is because the night-time is going to be when your Crested Gecko is going to be most active, as they're nocturnal. We reccomend providing a shallow water 
dish, but it's well documented that Crested Geckos can survive either way.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Can I Feed My Crested Gecko Fruit Pieces</h2>

The short answer is, only specific fruits like Banana or Mango, blended to a smoothie texture.
<br/>
<br/>
This should only be done everyonce and a while and IS NOT RECCOMENDED AS A DIET. Fruits are nutritious, especially when fresh, 
however the powdered diets that have been developed are a better source of primary nutrition for your pet Crested Gecko. There are many reasons, but in short the powder diets are going to be more all inclusive in terms of nutrients needed to maintain a healthy animal whom may still be growing.
If you do want to experiment or give your little sticky toe friend a treat, make sure to blend it down completely, and remove the left overs after 12-24 hours as fruit will mold/go bad quicker than the meal replacement mixtures.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Article Recap</h2>

It turns out feeding Crested Geckos is incredibly simple, thanks to high quality powdered diets that evolved to closest match what a Crested Gecko might eat in the wild, 
while maintaining a mixture that when fed correctly, provides a Crested Gecko with everything it needs for growth and daily maintenance. This mixture should be made and provided to your Crested Gecko every 1-2 days.
<br/>
<br/>
Insects are a staple, supplemental, piece of a Crested Geckos Diet and are reccomended to be provided to your Crested Gecko 1-2 times a week, or once a month at the very least.
Feeder insects should be Dusted with calcium and D3 before being fed to your animals. Make sure to alternate supplementation of D3 as it can be toxic to your Crested Gecko at too high of levels.
<br/>
<br/>
A shallow water bowl is reccomended to be provided, as your gecko may not drink from the mistings, and its just a safe measure to ensure your animal is hydrated, as well as will help maintain humidity.
Do not provide a dish that is too deep or slick for your animal to get out of, as it could drown. Mistings 1-2 times a day (based on humidity needs) may be a sufficient source of hydration if you don't feel 
comfortable leaving a water dish, however we don't reccomend this.
<br/>
<br/>
Fresh fruit is not to be anything other than a rare treat. We reccomend blending the fruit into a smoothie textured mixture. There is many fruits that Crested Geckos can eat, just do your research before feeding them to your animal.
This mixture is not to be left in your animals enclosure for longer than a day maximum.
