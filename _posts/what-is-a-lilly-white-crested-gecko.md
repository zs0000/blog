Lilly White Crested Geckos have become the favorite of many in the reptile keeping hobby. Ever since 2010, the year the first Lilly White Crested Gecko was born, The morph/gene has grown in popularity and demand. Thankfully, the Lilly White Gene is a co-dominant genetic, which means about half of the eggs that come from any pairing with a Lilly White. This is spectacular, however there is a small chance for the gene to pass down neurlogical issues. Nothing severe, however this will be discussed below, along with Why you shouldn't pair two Lilly White Crested Geckos together.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">What Is A Lilly White Crested Gecko?</h2>

The Lilly White Crested Gecko is a shocking, semi-recently new addition to the Crested Gecko Genetic Pool. These animals were quickly sought after as its been a goal for many line breeders to produce high white animals, or creamy animals, and the pattern color on these geckos were unmatched, and unseen. Though it appears to be very different with a full pattern color of White running down its Raised Scaling on its laterals, highlighting it's crests, and filling its dorsal, the Lilly White is still a Crested Gecko, and not very different from "normal" Crested Geckos. Unique, and One-of-a-kind, Lilly Whites are still great a great pet for keepers and breeders. It should be mentioned there are a few minor drawbacks to breeding Lilly Whites, such as a Lethal Leucistic Super Form, and a 3-5% of being born with a neurological issue, that will be discussed below in later sections of the article.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Where Did Lilly White Crested Geckos Come From?</h2>

The first Lilly White Crested Gecko ever was born in 2010, in the United Kingdom, by The Crested Gecko Breeder Lilly Exotics. A very passionate breeder, Lilly Exotics focused on finding out more about the Lilly White gene, and was incredibly fortunate that the first ever produced Lilly White Crested Gecko was Male. For people new to the hobby, this is an extremely positive outcome as it meant that the First ever Lilly White would be able to pair with several females in one breeding season, as opposed to a singular pairing, resulting in many more eggs in the first year breeding him - which ultimately allowed for quick replication of the genetic. If it wasn't for Lilly Exotic's extreme curiousity and passion, we wouldn't know as much as we do, and thankfully it wasn't long before other breeders in the hobby were able to get their hands on A Lilly White Crested Gecko. I hope this answers the where, and who produced the first lilly white crested gecko.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Is The Lilly White Gene Co-dominant?</h2>

After years of working with the Lilly White Genetics from Lilly Exotics, several breeders have established that the Lilly White gene is co-dominant. Put simply, this means around half of the offspring produced by a Crested Gecko pairing with one Lilly White, one "normal" Crested gecko, will be Lilly Whites hatchlings, and the other half should be "normal" hatchling Crested Geckos. Some of the breeders working with the Lilly White genetics early on suspected the gene to be co-dominant, or dominant because of how often they were hatching. It has since then been proven out by several breeders, who have also given us more insight into the Leucistic Super Form, that comes from pairing two Lilly White Crested Geckos together.Although, you should NEVER pair two Lilly Whites together, we cover why in <a>Is There A Lilly White Super Form?</a>
<span id="is-there-a-lilly-white-super-form"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Is There A Lilly White Super Form?</h2>

The short answer would be yes, however more context and information is required. It isn't abnormal to wonder What happens if you pair two Lilly White Crested Gecko, but it isn't a good idea. When two Crested Geckos  that have the Lilly White gene are paired together, you can produce the Lilly White Super form, but it is fatal. Many people have wondered if the Lilly White Super Form is Leucistic, and it is.  There is no reported super form, or leucistic hatchlings that have survived. The reason as to why this is hasn't been figured out yet - but is apparently common in other reptiles with leucistic animals. Some survive longer than others, but never without help (supplemental hand feeding, insects, etc.). Because of this, it is never reccomended to pair two lilly whites together.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Can A Lilly White Be Paired with a "Normal" Crested Gecko?</h2>

Pairing a normal Crested Gecko with a Lilly White Crested Gecko is completely fine! The issues that arise from the Lilly White Super Form are not found in "Normal-to-Lilly" pairings, however they still have around a 3-5% chance of receiving the neurological issue discussed in <a style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;" href="#do-lilly-white-crested-geckos-have-neurological-problems">Do Lilly White Crested Geckos Have Neurological Problems?</a> The issue is not severe, but is still worth mentioning. Its the one thing no one will tell you about the Lilly White mutation. Most people will mention the co-dominant part of the gene, which is spectacular. This means that roughly half of the Offspring produced will be Lilly Whites. In most cases, breeders in the hobby are pairing it with a "normal" or non lilly crested gecko, as axanthics are quite rare and expensive.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Do Lilly White Crested Geckos Have Neurlogical Problems?</h2>

Around 3-5% of Lilly Whites produced will have a very-slight suspected neurological issue. The way this is displayed on the animal, is a slight tilt of the head, that persists sometimes, and in some cases most of the time. Most breeders who have noticed this have started selling the Lilly White Crested Geckos with the disclaimer that they're to be "Pet Only" which ensures anyone who is buying it knows not to use it for breeding, as it may pass down this trait and increase the chances of creating offspring that express that trait. The trait doesn't seem to have a major affect on the Lilly White otherwise, as many breeders report they eat normally, and function normally. Since the percentage is so low, I wouldn't be discouraged or paranoid about buying a Lilly White Crested Gecko if you were in one, but it is something to keep in mind - and it doesn't hurt to Politely ask the Breeder if the Lilly White has head-tilt or is pet only before purchasing. Manners are important, as many of these people pride themselves on care and quality, and its always helpful in resolving questions both quickly, consisely, and direct.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">How Does The Lilly White Morph Interact With Other Morphs?</h2>

What the Lilly White genetics do when combined with genetics like Super Dalmations, or Soft scales, is quite amazing. This is still an on-going field of research as Lilly Whites are relatively new to the United States, (around 6-8 years now). We do know some interesting findings, for example When you pair a Super Dalmation to a Lilly White, most of the time you are going to produce a High white or High Cream Lilly White with a vibrant orange base color. With the right Orange and Cream combination, the Crested Gecko Breeding Hobby would call this a Creamsicle Lilly White Crested Gecko. It should be noted, there is Creamsicle non-lilly-white crested geckos as well.

Many breeders are looking to create their dream full-coverage crested gecko. Full coverage refers to the patterning color covering th crested geckos, which in this case would be a High or Full white Crested Gecko. High White Crested Geckos has always been something a large portion of the community was drawn towards, and had been regarded as a potential sign for a well-bred, well-picked, genetic line. With the addition of the Lilly White Gene, producing an all-white, full-coverage Crested Gecko was going to be that much more simple, and quick. Line breeding can take generations which sometimes are seperated by as long as 2-3 years, as it takes time for the newer generations to get up to weight and produce viable off-spring. The first lilly whites ever bought were very pricey, and definitely regarded as investments by many collectors. 
<span id="why-are-lilly-whites-so-expensive"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Why Are Lilly Whites So Expensive?</h2>

There is a number of factors that determine the price of any given High-end Crested Gecko, especially with morphs that aren't as common, such as the Lilly White. Supply and demand being the driving force, just like any other market, Lilly White Crested Geckos are more rare than "normal" Crested Geckos - however this is becoming less and less true each year. If You were worried about the price of Lilly White's stopping you from buying one, soon in the future you should be able to find an afforadble lilly white crested gecko. This is because of the genetics being co-dominant, and being replicated at around approximately 50% of the times. As this happens, the supply will be higher, leading to lower prices for those High White, one of a kind, High-end Crested Geckos that carry, and display the Lilly White Gene.

Huge thanks to Lilly Exotics for creating, sharing, and educating the reptile hobby on everything Lilly Whites. It's been such a fun addition to the Crested Gecko keeping and breeding hobby, and it definitely sparked our curiosity. We hope to have fufilled much of your curiousity, as we think that the Lilly White makes a great addition to anyone's collection, whether you consider yourself a breeder, keeper, or collector. The expense is well justified as they're truely one of a kind animals, and a "normal" (We love all morphs and Crested Geckos!) Crested Gecko can be found anywhere for much lower costs, however its going to have much more commonly found genetics, thus commonly looking more similar to other animals. We did find out the Lilly White gene is co-dominant, and with fastly growing popularity, soon an affordable Lilly White Crested gecko will be a reality, as the supply will easier keep up with demand. This also does mean, a super form is easier to achieve, however that leucistic super form is always fatal. It's recommended to never pair two lilly white crested geckos. When breeding a Lilly white to a "normal" crested gecko (non Lilly White) you should always watch for the "head tilt" that can be present in 3-5% of the offspring, as this is a suspected neurological issue that comes from the Lilly White genetics. We don't think this should discourage you from buying one for Keeping, or Collecting, but if you are breeding lilly whites, be careful and cautious as you don't want to breed animals who have the head tilt, as you'd be lowering the quality of the genetic pool in captive bred Crested geckos, which is larger than in the wild.
