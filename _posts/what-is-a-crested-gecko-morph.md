Crested Geckos come in a wide variety of looks and colors, typically referenced by their morphs and or traits. To avoid making beginners feel overwhlemed or confused, Nandatil26 on Pangea Forums created a graphic, in which a snippet is featured above this article! In this article we'll be discussing what makes a crested gecko a specific more like a "Super Dalmatian" or a "Flame Crested Gecko" by breaking it up into morphs and traits (such as pinstripes, dalmatian spots, etc), aswell as redirecting you to a beginner's crested gecko crash course. For More advanced breeders we'll be recommending an interview done by Pangea Reptile with Tom Favarazza and guests, as they discuss their findings over the course of 8+ years, regarding Crested Gecko Genetics, Morphs and traits!
<span id="what-are-traits"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">What are Traits?</h2>

Traits are unique, specific, individual visual qualities expressed in Crested Geckos. Example genetic traits might be Dalmatian spots, Pinstriping, Blushing (referring to the underside throat), Portholes, etc. It's important to understand the difference between traits and morphs, because something like the Super Dalmatian is referred to as if its a morph, when spotting is a genetic trait that can be visually expressed within multiple different morphs (example: a harlequin crested gecko with a few spots). 
<span id="what-are-morphs"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">What are Morphs?</h2>

Morphs are uniquely named identifiers that allow the Crested Gecko Keeping and Breeding community to consistently, and accurately categorize Crested Geckos that carry and visually express certain genetic traits like pinstriping for example. This specificity allows for a much more accelerated, and calcuated approach to everything from buying crested geckos, to breeding crested geckos - which is especially helpful given how little is actually known about Crested Gecko genetics, atleast when compared to other reptiles. Feel free to use the navigation guide at the top of the article to find out more about a specific morph you have in mind.
<span id="brindle"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">The Brindle Crested Gecko Morph</h2>

If you've ever seen Brindle coating on a dog, or other animal, you might be picturing something a little different. Here is a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/images/companies/1/untitled%20folder%201/Morph%20Guide/brindle-crested-gecko-Ei65b.jpg?1524765477432" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Brindle Crested Gecko</a> On Pangea Reptile's website. The Brindle morph is easily identifiable thanks to its unique, broken and seperated stripes that zag and wave. If you're breeding for Brindle Crested Geckos, we recommend sticking with brindle, phantom, or tiger animals for the pairing.
<span id="harlequin"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">The Harlequin Crested Gecko Morph</h2>

The Harlequin Crested Gecko Morph is much easier to understand or identify if you've seen a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/images/companies/1/untitled%20folder%201/Morph%20Guide/red-crested-gecko.jpg?1524764596532" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Patternless</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/images/companies/1/untitled%20folder%201/Morph%20Guide/Bz100b.jpg?1524765012730" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Bi-Color</a> Crested Gecko first. The contrast and defining characteristics of a Harlequin Crested Gecko is typically the level of patterning that comes up the sides of the gecko, a.k.a the laterals of the Crested Gecko. The color of the patterning expressed visually by the harlequin genetic is usually lighter than the base color. Here are two example photos of Harlequin Crested Geckos directly hosted on Pangea's site once again. Example <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/images/companies/1/untitled%20folder%201/Morph%20Guide/Bz2c.jpg?1524766161392" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Cream And Red Base Harlequin </a>and example <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/images/companies/1/untitled%20folder%201/Morph%20Guide/Bz28c.jpg?1524766210046" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Tri-color Harlequin</a>
<span id="extreme-harlequin"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">The Extreme Harlequin Crested Gecko Morph</h2>

The Extreme Harlequin Morphs is visually expressed in a similar way to the Harlequin Morph, with a few differences. Extreme Harlequin Crested Geckos will have much more patterning than a regular harlequin, and will often times run from the dorsal all the way to the laterals. Following the theme of some earlier posts, here are some great example photos of two extreme harlequin crested geckos hosted publicly on Pangea <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/images/companies/1/untitled%20folder%201/Morph%20Guide/Dx92dd.jpg?1524766985027" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">First Extreme Harlequin Crested Gecko </a>and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/images/companies/1/untitled%20folder%201/Morph%20Guide/Extreme-harlequin-Crested-Gecko-Dc17a.jpg?1524767016317" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Second Extreme Harelquin Crested Gecko</a>
<span id="tri-color"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">The Tri-Color Crested Gecko Morph</h2>

The Tri-Color Crested Gecko morph is much like it's name sounds, and thus, easier to identify than many other Morphs. Tri-colors can come in a variety or combinations, as there is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/images/companies/1/untitled%20folder%201/Morph%20Guide/crested-gecko-Dc66bb.jpg?1525119862658" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Tri-color Reverse Pinstripes</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://acreptiles.com/new_store/images/detailed/5/032918_U29_3-4g_UN_Soft_Scale_Jet_Black_Halloween_Tri-Color_Quad_Stripe_-_Thick,_Long,_Spiny_Lateral_Striping_-_Absolute_Perfection_-_Web__600_-_BIN-Sale__399_1.jpg" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Tri-color quadstripes</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/images/companies/1/untitled%20folder%201/Morph%20Guide/crested-gecko-Ge90b.jpg?1525119823882" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">tri-color harlequins</a>, etc. This doesn't mean any animal that contains three colors is a tri-color, as many Crested Geckos will have shades of their patterning color and or shades or their base color. Refer to the Linked examples in this section, for examples of the three variations we described.
<span id="patternless"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">The Patternless Crested Gecko Morph</h2>

The Patternless Crested Gecko is going to be the easiest to identify Crested Gecko Morph. This is probably obvious and the morph is visually expressed how it sounds. Patternless Crested Geckos will be just that, a Patternless animal covered in base color. Here is an example <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/images/companies/1/untitled%20folder%201/Morph%20Guide/red-crested-gecko.jpg?1524764596532" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Patternless Crested Gecko</a> from Pangea Reptile.
<span id="flame"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">The Flame Crested Gecko Morph</h2>

Flame Crested Geckos are similar to harlequins in the sense that they have multiple colors, and also include patterning on the laterals and dorsal. The Flame Crested Gecko morph won't visually express as much lateral patterning as a harelquin, so harlequins sometimes are regarded to as upgraded flames. Similar to a harlequin, flames usually have a large contrast in base and patterning color . Here is an example <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/images/companies/1/untitled%20folder%201/Morph%20Guide/crested-gecko-Dc93b.jpg?1524765856936" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Flame Crested Gecko</a> from Pangea Reptile.
<span id="tiger"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">The Tiger Crested Gecko Morph</h2>

Tiger Crested Geckos can be identified by semi-dark to dark streaks that span from the sides to atleast somewhere in the dorsal, running through crests typically, and sometimes going beyond down the other side. Tigers are very similar to brindles with more complete, long, semi-uniform lines. Typically, the tiger morph is going to have lighter earth tones for base and patterning color, but not always. Here in an example <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/images/companies/1/untitled%20folder%201/Morph%20Guide/crested-gecko-Ei2b.jpg?1524765344473" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Tiger Crested Gecko</a> from Pangea Reptile.
<span id="creamsicle"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">The Creamsicle Crested Gecko Morph</h2>

As a morph, the Creamsicle crested gecko morph is semi new to the hobby. The Creamsicle Crested Gecko is going to be an animal that has a light, usually white or cream patterning color with a orange to orangish yellow base color. In many cases these Creamsicle Crested Geckos contain and visually express the Lilly White Gene, but there are many breeders who have created high white, amazing creamsicles without the need for the Lilly White Gene. Here is an example <a target="_blank" href="https://rhacemup.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/northern-va-gecko-creamsicle.jpg" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Creamsicle Crested Gecko</a> from Northern Gecko.
<span id="halloween"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">The Halloween Crested Gecko Morph</h2>

Usually the Halloween Crested Gecko Morph is the first discovered by a beginner keepers, who are just getting into high-end crested gecko genetics, only second to maybe the flame morph. This is because the Halloween Morph features striking contrast, with bold colors Orange and Black. Lineage should be explored to ensure that orange found in hatchling or offspring will stay, and not vanish with age. Here is an example <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/images/companies/1/untitled%20folder%201/Morph%20Guide/Halloween-crested-gecko.jpg?1525121057709" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Halloween Crested Gecko</a> from Pangea Reptiles.
<span id="dalmatian"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">The Super Dalmatian/Dalmatian Crested Gecko Morph</h2>

If A Crested Gecko has spotting, it may be considered a dalmatian, even in combination with other morphs such as harelquins, meaning a harlequin dalmatian crested gecko. However, super dalmatians and pure dalmatian crested geckos are animals that lack patterning and have a reasonably significant amount of spotting or coverage. The super dalmatian morph is reserved for animals with exceptional amount of coverage such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CQ8qentsXL0/" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">this one</a>
From altitude exotics Instagram 
<span id="lilly-white"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">The Lilly White Crested Gecko Morph</h2>

The Lilly White genetic is a mutattion that popped up randomly from Lilly Exotics in the UK. Crested Geckos that visually express the Lilly White gene are very easily identifiable, with their stomachs being mainly white or cream (typically whatever the animals patterning color is). Lilly White Crested Geckos also have raised lateral scaling, similar to quad stripes, but with much mor coverage. Lilly whites are some of the highest white Crested Geckos you will ever see. Here is an example <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CQ_WpimM_AD/" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;" >Lilly White</a> from Altitude Exotics on instagram.For more information, feel free to read our article - <a target="_blank" href="/posts/what-is-a-lilly-white-crested-gecko" style="text-decoration:underline;">What is a Lilly White Crested Gecko?</a>
<span id="axanthic"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">The Axanthic Crested Gecko Morph</h2>

The Axanthic Morph in Crested Geckos is the complete opposite of the Lilly White Gene, in every sense. Axanthic Crested Geckos will feature a dark base color when fired up, such as black, charcoal, or grey. and when fired down could be a range of colors from light purple to white, to pinkish white, to pale white. Axanthic crested geckos dont typically have much patterning, nor do they feature complete pinstripes that often. Here is an example <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRCIUp2Mv7n/" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Axanthic Crested Gecko</a> from Altitude Exotics on instagram.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">The Pie Bald Crested Gecko: Patient Zero</h2>

A fun addition, the Pie Bald Crested Gecko Morph isn't yet confirmed whether it can be reproduced, or passed down genetically. Currently only one exists, and it's over at pangea Reptiles. This Crested Gecko is well-known in the community, earning himself the branded name Patient Zero. Patient Zero can be seen over on their site at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/piebald-crested-gecko.html" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Piebald Crested Geckos</a>
