Setting up your first Crested Geckos enclosure is all about providing your animal with everything it needs, and ensuring it feels comfortable and doesn't become over stressed. It can be quite simple to maintain once you have a complete enclosure. Let's find out what things we'll need to complete our new pet gecko's home! 
<span id="enclosure"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Choosing the Proper Enclosure</h2>

Picking a home for your Crested Gecko depends on a few factors, such as Weight and budget. For beginners, we recommend going with known prebuilt enclosure brands like Exo-terra, Zilla, Zoo Med, Thrive, etc. These brands all supply homes with proper ventilation, and varying dimensions. For hatchling's we recommend the Exo Terra Faunarium or Exo Terra Nano. For Juvenile/sub-adult Crested Geckos we recommend a 12x12x18. For adults , a 12x12x18 can work, but if possible a larger enclosure like a 18x18x24 would allow for more space, and a higher quality of life for your animal. If you're a more experienced keeper, and want to potentially create DIY Crested Gecko enclosures check out our article <a href="/posts/what-size-tank-do-i-need-for-a-crested-gecko" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">What Size Tank Does My Crested Gecko Need?</a> Where we detail everything DIY Enclosures, from the sterlite containers that can be made into equivalent space DIY Crested Gecko enclosures, to how to provide proper airflow.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Completing the Inside with Plants</h2>

For beginners we recommend using fake plants rather than real plants. Maintaining real plants, and the complications that come with loose substrate is unnecessary added stress for beginners, and this article is focused of first time set ups for hatchling, juvenile, and adult Crested Geckos. Brands like Exo Terra, Flukers, and several others sell plants that are safe to use to complete your enclosure. Not only do plants help bring your reptile enclosure to life, creating a gorgeous spectacle, they also provide visual barriers for your Crested Geckos. These visual barriers help reduce stress, and provide places to sleep or hide. A lot of the plants will also catch and store water from mistings. Any fake plants that don't leak ink, or contain harfmul chemical, or have sharp edges or points, will work. 
<span id="hides"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Providing Hides</h2>

Reptile hides are another option for your Crested Gecko to avoid stress. Some hides also maintain higher moisture, which will provide a higher humidity area for your Crested Gecko, and higher the probability of cleaner sheds. Several major reptile brands sell premade hides, typically made from plastic. Another great option that will maintain a more natural look is <a href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/cork-bark-for-sale.html" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Cork Bark Rounds</a>. . Pangea Reptile sells these in Bulk, or single, or mystery bags. 
<span id="lay-box"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Do I Need to Provide a Lay Box?</h2>

If you have a Female Crested Gecko above 20-25 grams, you should provide a lay box and semi moisturized substrate - typically eco earth or sphagnum moss. Be sure not to over moisturize the substrate as it could cause mold growth. If you have Male Crested Gecko only, you do not need a lay box. Be sure to provide easy access and exit from the lay box. It doesn't need to be that large, just ensure your Laying females have room to dig and its not to hard to get out of. 
<span id="substrate"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Substrate</h2>

For Beginners we recommend paper towels for substrate, with no ink, just plain. This will make changing them out when it comes time to do your first enclosure cleaning, as well as ensure your don't have to worry about your Crested Geckos ingesting substrate and causing impaction. If you insist on substrate, Eco Earth is a good option. This would also be a decent soil choice for Bio-Active Enclosures should you choose to use live plants. For Bio-active enclosures we recommend utilizing UVB lights as well to keep plants healthy.
<span id="lighting"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Lighting</h2>

Lighting isn't a necessity if you're supplementing vitamin d3 with your Crested Gecko's dusted insects. If you do want to provide lighting, please make sure to use daylight uvb lights, and not heat lamps. Never use Heat lamps or extra heat sources. Some good options for UVB Lighting is the Zoo Med Naturalitic Terrarium Hood (12 or 18 inch), or the Exo Terra PT2355. Utilizing a day/night timer can also help ensure your Crested Gecko isn't over exposed to UVB, and to make sure you don't mess with the animals day and night cycles. 
<span id="food-water"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Providing Food and Water</h2>

To complete your first pet geckos home, you must provide a food and water bowl. Make sure neither of the dishes are too deep, slick, or hard to escape and access. It's recommended to clean and replace the dishes and their contents every other day. If you're unsure what to feed your crested gecko or what they can eat, please check out <a href="/posts/what-do-crested-geckos-eat" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">What Do Crested Geckos Eat?</a> where we detail the foods, brands, and insects that make up a Crested Gecko's diet.
