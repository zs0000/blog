Even if you're confident in your care, know how to breed Crested Geckos can be daunting to put into action. That's why we've created this Beginner's guide to Breeding Crested Gecko's for the first time! Feel free to save or share the link for later reference. There is a lot of valuable information, that can be hard to memorize in detail!
<span id="breeding-weight"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Recommended Minimum Weight</h2>

The minimum weight recommended for a Breeding Crested depends on their sex, and if they have a tail or are tailess. A Male Crested Gecko, that has a tail, should weigh a minimum of 35-40 grams before mating. A Female Crested Gecko with a tail should weigh 45+ grams minimum before breeding. Tailess gecko's can be bred about 2-3 grams lower than geckos with tails, however the recommended minimum breeding weight is 45 grams. 
<span id="breeding-age"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Recommended Minimum Age</h2>

Many breeders and keepers in the hobby go based off weight, but some people will advise that Breeding Female Cresties should be atleast 1 1/2 - 2 years old, however there isn't a community standard. Ultimately, breed at your discretion, and aslong as the Crested Gecko in question is at the recommended minimum weight, it should be fine. 
<span id="housing-and-enclosure"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Choosing the right Enclosure</h2>

The Size of the enclosure required to breed Crested Geckos Is completely dependant on whether you are breeding a single 1 on 1 pairing, or a male with 3 females, typically known as a breeding group. A Breeding Pair (1 on 1), should have a minimum of 18x18x24 or 18x18x36, or 42 to 48 quart equivalent if using tubs. If this cannot be provided, it's recommended to split the pairing after a confirmed lock, or shouldn't be bred at all. Only experienced breeders should be breeding in groups. In this case a 60 quart tub with proper ventilation, furnishing, and multiple food bowls. Always pay attention for bullying or aggression as Crested Gecko's may become territorial.
<span id="mating-behavior"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Mating Behavior vs Aggression?</h2>

Mating in the Crested Gecko world is never going to be delicate, but you don't want either of your breeding geckos to get injured or drop weight very fast. Male Crested Geckos might bite the legs, tails, neck, or dorsal of female cresteds when matiing, and this is considered normal, assuming the male isnt causing open wounds. If the Male is being overly aggressive or injuring the female, they must be seperated. Injuries should be treated immediately and fully healed before reintroducing a pair. It might be best in some cases to just not breed a overly aggressive male or female, although it could be dependant on temperature as well. 
<span id="lay-box"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Lay Box</h2>

A Lay Box is a container with a semi moist substrate like sphaghnum moss or eco earth, that has easy acesss and exit, for your Female Crested Gecko to lay their eggs in. Be very careful not to over saturate the substrate - as this can cause the enclosure, substrate, or eggs to develop mold. If you're unsure of how large it needs to be, here is an <a href="https://www.lornasredskygeckos.com/uploads/7/9/1/7/7917924/gladlayingeggs.jpg?276" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Example Lay Box</a>
<span id="incubation-medium"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Incubation Medium</h2>

The term Incubation Medium refers to the substrates people use to incubate their Crested Gecko Eggs. It's very simple to set up and maintain if you use some of the quality products many of the breeders and keepers use in the hobby. For simplicity, and consistency in hatch rate, you can use <a href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/hatchrite.html" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">HatchRite</a> or <a href="https://www.pangeareptile.com/store/pangea-hatch.html" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Pangea Hatch</a>. These are very commonly used, and seem to maintain optimal moisture. HatchRite comes pre moisturized and is a pour and go type product. Pangea Hatch requires about 10-15 minutes of setup, but can be boiled and reused.
<span id="incubation-temperature"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Incubation Temperature</h2>

Crested Geckos eggs should be kept and incubated at anywhere between 68-75 degrees fahrenheit. Higher incubation temperatures will lead to faster hatch rates, however this will commonly lead to smaller Hatchlings (around 1-2 grams typically). Smaller hatchlings will need lower living temperatures (68-76, ideally in the middle). Lower incubation temperatures could lead to incubation lengths up to 130 days, but will hatch bigger hatchling crested geckos with better structure.
<span id="incubation-length"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Incubation Length</h2>

The time it takes for Crested Gecko eggs to hatch varies greatly. The length of time a egg incubates before hatching depends on the temperature it was incubated at, for the most part. As discussed in the above section, Lower incubation temperatures of (68-72) will lead to longer incubation times, around 90-130 days, with larger hatchlings. Higher incubation temperatures (72-75) will lead to much shorter incubation periods, but smaller hatchlings.
<span id="egg-teeth"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">What Are Egg Teeth?</h2>

Egg teeth are temporary, external teeth a hatchling develops in the egg. These temporary teeth are used to slice through the shell of the egg when it comes time to hatch. These teeth quickly after fall off, usually within the first day. 
<span id="housing-hatchlings"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Housing Hatchlings</h2>

Hatchlings Crested Geckos should be individually housed, in an enclosure like a Exo-terra nano, a 6 quart sterlite container with proper air flow, or a Exo Terra Faunarium. Hatchlings should be kept in these enclosures until weights around 10-15 grams. 
<span id="cutting-eggs"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Cutting Eggs</h2>

In uncommon instances, Crested Gecko Breeders will cut a small slit in the top of the egg to help the hatchling escape the egg, essentially beginning the hatch process. This is recommended only for experienced breeders, as it's only supposed to be done when incubation times are running longer than expected, or under rare circumstances like a multi-day sweat, with movement, but no hatch. 
<span id="fertile-or-non-fertile-eggs"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Are These Crested Gecko Eggs Fertile?</h2>

Determining whether a Crested Gecko Egg is fertile is very simple if you have a pen-light, or your cellphone has a flashlight. With the egg held horizontally over the light, look for something that looks like a  "thin red cheerio". We're going to take this brief excerpt from our one of our articles," <a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uXZ3FMan9C0/UT0qdlme0iI/AAAAAAAAAqE/EXI_KhfJkvU/w644-h428-o-k/001%2B%25281%2529.JPG" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Here</a> is an example of an egg that had a very, very slight "Red Cheerio" on the first day the breeder found it, and <a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-crtYJ19yTvE/UT0qm6pkD2I/AAAAAAAAAqM/qTkRO-0yXN4/w760-h428-o-k/100MEDIA%2524IMAG0678.jpg" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">here</a> is that same egg three days into incubation - showing much more apparent signs of fertility, with a much bolder "cheerio"."
<span id="breeding-season"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Breeding Season</h2>

The Breeding Season for Crested Geckos begins around end of January, start of February, running til around September, with a 3-4 month cooldown for your female, where she wouldn't be paired.  Some breeders do year round breeding, but this can be quite rough on your female breeders, and quality of eggs and hatchlings will quickly decline. Breeding begins around these times of the year when temperatures are lower, and your animals aren't going to be as energetic. This helps to lower aggression between pairings, but Crested geckos can be paired practically any time in the year if you know what you're doing. 
<span id="seperation"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Seperating Breeders</h2>

We recommend seperating breeders after a confirmed lock. You may be able to keep breeders together through out the entire breeding season if neither geckos are being aggressive, bullying, or dropping weight. Female Breeding Crested Geckos will retain enough sperm from the first latch to remain gravid for atleast 3 - 6 months.
<span id="number-of-eggs"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">How Many Eggs Are In a Clutch?</h2>

Crested Geckos lay between 1-2 eggs per clutch. Typically they will lay 2 per clutch, but in some instances will lay just a single egg. If this happens, you shouldn't worry right away, but should keep watch of your female as it may be egg bound. 
<span id="number-of-clutches"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">How Many Clutches Do Crested Geckos Lay Each Year?</h2>

Crested Geckos will lay around 4-10 clutches each breeding season, most commonly laying 5-7 clutches. This means you'll average around 6-14 new hatchlings from one breeding female each year!
<span id="cooldown"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Cooldown for Breeding Female Crested Geckos</h2>

Female Crested Geckos need a 3-4 month cooldown period where they are not being paired with a male. During this time they will rebuild their calcium and fat storages to ensure they produce quality eggs next season. Some breeders will alternate breeding seasons, an they honestly shouldnt be bred more than 3 consecutive seasons. 
<span id="injuries"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Injuries During Breeding</h2>

If either of your breeding Crested Gecko's sustain injuries during breeding, it should be treated immediately. Topical antibiotics may be necessary, as well as cleaning solutions like chlorahexadine (properly diluted). If the injury is serious, we recommend contacting a vet or reptile expert for immediate help.
<span id="calcium-sacks"></span>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Caclium Sacks</h2>

It's important for your female breeders to have plenty of calcium, as producing eggs can take a toll on the calcium storage of your crested gecko, stored in pouches in their mouth, called calcium sacks. To replenish calcium sacks or ensure they never go empty, we recommend feeding gutloaded calcium dusted insects.
