Crested Geckos do not give live birth, Instead, Crested Geckos do lay eggs, but not just anywhere. In this article we'll break down how egg production and laying affects Female Crested Geckos, as well as many other importants facts about the egg making and laying process!

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">How Many Eggs Do Crested Geckos Lay Each Year?</h2>

Crested Geckos will lay 1-2 eggs per clutch, and anywhere between 4-10 clutches in a year. It's most common for it to be around 5-7 clutches from what we've seen, but like anything else, this varies. If we were to assume a Female Crested Gecko was going to lay 7 clutches, with 2 eggs per clutch, that comes out to a total of 14 baby geckos a season/year. The number of babies a year that a pair of crested geckos can produce is one of the major reasons Crested Geckos are commonly regarded as proliific breeders.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">How Many Eggs Do Crested Geckos Lay At A Time?</h2>

The number of eggs a Female Crested Gecko can lay at one time ranges bewtween 1-2 eggs. Most commonly you will find eggs, both fertile and non-fertile, in pairs, though finding a single egg doesn't necessarily mean there is anything wrong with your reptile, however it could signify complications like being egg-bound. Just pay attention to the weight and shape of your breeding females and things should be fine! Egg Bound Females is more on the rare side in terms of how often or likely this is to happen, but it is not uncommon if there is complications that being egg bound is the issue.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">How Long Do Crested Gecko Eggs Take To Hatch?</h2>

This is commonly referred to as the incubation period, or time required to incubate the eggs. The time range for incubation period can go anywhere from 60 days to 130 days. It's important to monitor the status and health of your eggs, as mold and other factors could spoil the egg. For more information check out <a href="/posts/what-to-do-when-crested-geckos-lay-eggs" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">What To Do When Crested Geckos Lay Eggs</a> if you're looking for more detailed incubation info. We recommend controlling the temperature of your incubation room/space to around 68-72 degrees fahrenheit. Lower temperatures will lead to longer incubation periods for hatchling crested geckos. Longer incubation periods will result in larger, better structured Crested Geckos. Crested Geckos don't usually hatch any larger than 1-3g, and it's very helpful for both the breeder and the new hatchling, to find out more about why incubation period is important check out <a href="/posts/what-to-do-when-crested-geckos-lay-eggs" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Why Incubate Eggs For Longer?</a>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Is Laying Eggs Stressful On Female Crested Geckos?</h2>

The mating, production, and laying process can take a toll on your breeding female cresteds, however there are things you can do as a breeder and a keeper to create a much less stressful environment for egg laying. Calcium dusted insects are a must for breeding female cresteds, as producing eggs takes a toll on their calcium and fat levels. If feeding insects isn't something your able to do, we don't recommend breeding your female cresties. It doesn't mean guarenteed death for your hatchling or female breeder if you don't follow this rule, however Crested Geckos can experience something dangerous called <a href="#what-is-calcium-crash-in-crested-geckos" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Calcium Crash</a>, which will be discussed in detail in the next section. If your breeders don't have enough calcium in their calcium sacks <a href="/posts/how-to-check-a-crested-geckos-calcium-sacks" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;"> (How To Check A Crested Geckos Calcium Sacks)</a>, the eggs produced might be deformed since the shell is composed heavily from calcium, aswell as the hatchlings can developed <a href="/posts/what-is-metabolic-bone-disease" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD)</a> much faster from not having a strong start. 
<br/>
As for what can be dont enviromentally, we recommend providing your breeding pair no smaller than a 18x18x36 enclosure. It's recommended to either use a new neutral enclosure, or to place the male in the females enclosure. This is because Crested's can become quite territorial. Keeping your Cresteds paired in the same enclosure for longer than a week or two during breeding season should be reserved for more experienced keepers and breeders. Bullying can happen to both female, and male cresteds. Recently we split up a pairing on the second night because the female wasn't receptive to mating, and became very aggressive. The mating process is almost always rough, but over aggression is a sign things may not be working for now, and should be seperated.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">What Is Calcium Crash In Crested Geckos?</h2>

The term calcium crash refers to the effects Crested Geckos will display when low on calcium. Breeding Crested Geckos should have their calcium sacks checked regularly <a href="/posts/how-to-check-a-crested-geckos-calcium-sacks" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;"> (How To Check A Crested Geckos Calcium Sacks)</a>. As Crested Geckos start to dwindle on calcium storage, calcium will be taken from vital structures - like their bones. If these symptoms persist, Metabolic bone disease, malformation of the bones, spine, and eggs can occur. This might look like inflamed limbs, jaw, curved or malformed spine, a kinked/curvy tail, seizures, organ failure, and more. Calcium crash can occur in geckos of any lifestage, but most commonmly occurs in hatchlings and breeding females. Typically hatchlings only experience calcium crash if the mother laid eggs without sufficient calcium, but can also be caused by malnutrition, or consistently high temperatures without insects, which could cause hatchlings to grow faster than they have the nutritonal storages to keep up with.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">How Do Hatchling Crested Geckos Get Out The Egg?</h2>

When it comes time for a Baby crested gecko to hatch, hatchling cresteds use what is called "egg teeth" to slice through the shell of the egg. Egg Teeth are temporary external teeth hatchling crested geckos grow while inside of the egg for the sole purpose of getting out. In some cases, breeders will carefully slice the egg open, but this is rare and recommended to be reserved for expert keepers and breeders. An example scenario might be that they have an egg thats going for around 110-130 days, and showing signs of "sweating" on the outside of the egg. The reason they cut the egg, is sometimes hatchlings have a hard time getting out, and they don't want the baby to drown. Typically hatchlings don't need any help to escape the egg, but should you need to help - this would be the option.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Article Recap</h2>

Similar to some other reptiles, Crested Geckos do lay eggs and bury them. Each time a Crested Gecko lays eggs they're referred to as clutches. Clutches can range in sizes from 1-2 eggs, most commonly two. A gravid female crested gecko will lay anywhere between 4-10 clutches a season, typically they lay 5-7 clutches. To ensure quality eggs and hatchlings, calcium levels should be maintained and checked normally. If your unsure how to do that, or what calcium sacks are, check out <a href="/posts/how-to-check-a-crested-geckos-calcium-sacks" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;"> How To Check A Crested Geckos Calcium Sacks</a>. Checking on calcium sacks will also help avoid Calcium Crash. Once again, we don't recommend breeding crested geckos unless you can feed and provide weekly to twice weekly gutloaded, calcium dusted insects.
<br/>
Breeding can be stressful on your geckos so it's important to ensure you provide the proper space for a breeding pair (minimum 18x18x36). Using a neutral, new enclosure helps to avoid territorial behavior. Another option is to place the male crested gecko in the female cresteds enclosure for a week or two, before seperating back into original enclosures. Pairs should always be monitored for bullying or overly territorial behavior.
<br/>
Crested Gecko's develop egg teeth while inside of the egg. These are temporary, external teeth used for the sole purpose of escaping the egg. Shortly after, these temporary, external teeth fall off. Cutting eggs should be saved for expert, and experienced keepers and breeders.
