Before diving into the details of the Axanthic Crested Gecko, it's important to understand what Axanthic means. Axanthic refers to a genetic mutation that causes an reptile, in this case an Crested Gecko, to be unable to produce yellow pigment, or red pigment. Lacking Pigment could be the reason the Axanthic Crested Geckos looks like something you'd see in your nightmares, or like it just escaped through a chimney.

When somebody says "an Axanthic Crested Gecko", what they're referring to is an Crested Gecko that visually displays the Axanthic Gene, which is a recessive genetic mutation. More on this will be covered below, but it's important we clarify. Visual axanthic Crested Geckos will appear similar to the Fired up Axanthic Crested Gecko pictured at the top of the article. Visual axanthics can appear in a range of colors depending on if they're in shed, fired up, etc. Some of the colors you might see visual axanthics appear are purple, violet, charcoal, grey, white, black, and everything in-between. This does not mean every dark, or nearly charcoal animal is an axanthic, as some dark projects like the charcoal project from altitude exotics can get pretty dark, but they do not carry the axanthic gene unless specified. Some Buckskin Crested Geckos resemble axanthics as some of them fire very dark. When you see one in person, you'll know, as Visual axanthics are very easy to identify.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Is The Axanthic Mutation a Reccessive Gene?</h2>

The Axanthic Crested Gecko mutation is a recessive gene. This is important to understand for a couple of reasons, but it signifies the "random" event that one was born, wasn't completely random. Maybe not purposeful, but creating a visual axanthic relies on breeding isolated lines / isolated genetics. Assuming Mandelian genetics, it's an impossibility to create a visual axanthic from pairing two crested geckos where at least one crested gecko doesnt carry the gene. An interesting project to look into for Crested Gecko enthusiast, and those interested in Crested Gecko Genetics, should check out Altitude Exotics Lilly White Axanthic project. The Lilly white gene is a co-dominant genetic trait, and the axanthic mutation is a recessive genetic trait, so it took dedication in the creation of the first visual axanthic lilly whites. if you've never heard of Lilly whites, check out <a href="/what-is-a-lilly-white-crested-gecko" style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">What is a Lilly White Crested Gecko?</a>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Why Are Axanthic Crested Geckos So Expensive?</h2>

Being a recessive genetic mutation, The Axanthic Crested Geckos is harder to reproduce - visually - than most, if not all other reproducable morphs. This is the primary driving factor is the pricing of an axanthic crested gecko. Supply and demand drives prices in most markets, and the High end Crested Gecko market is definitely no exception to that rule.Unfortunately, if your wondering "Where can I buy an affordable Axanthic Crested Gecko", it's not going to exist for a long time. However, for those who have followed axanthics ever since it was first seen , some would consider axanthics to be much more affordable now, as compared to a year prior. With that being said, Most visual axanthic crested geckos, at the time of writing this article, are being listed in the ranges between $5,000 to $12,000 on average. If it's a visaul Lilly White Axanthic, we've seen prices over $20,000 quite easily. The lilly White gene is co-dominant, and the Axanthic mutation is a recessive gene, so creating a visual axanthic lilly white crested gecko is tough, because in the even you create het lilly white offspring, they cant be bred back to a het lilly, or eachother, as breeding two lilly whites together results in a lethal leucistic super form in half of its eggs - more on this can be read about in <a style="color:black;text-decoration:underline;" href="/posts/what-is-a-lilly-white-crested-gecko">What Is A Lilly White Crested Gecko?</a>

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">What Happens If You Breed An Axanthic To A "Normal"?</h2>

Pairing an axanthic crested gecko to a "normal" crested will result in normal, healthy off-spring, just like pairing any other type of crested's together. You will not reproduce Axanthic Crested Gecko's though. The condition in which an Axanthic crested gecko will visually reproduce are very specific. This requires your to pair two 100% axanthics together. In the section below we will be discussing and breaking down exactly what you need to reproduce a visual axanthic crested gecko.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">How Do I Reproduce Visual Axanthics?</h2>

Reproducing Visual Axanthic Crested Geckos can be tough because the traits nature - a recessive genetic mutation. Which means if you want produce a Visual axanthic, you're going to need two 100% het axanthics. there is a range of percentage het (short for heterozygous) commonly aggreed upon numbers are 50%, 66%, 100%, representing how many generations down the gene has been bred already. A 100% het axanthic will cost any where between $2,500 - $5,000 (at the time of writing this article), but is the best way to get started if producing Visual Axanthics is your goal.

<h2 style="font-family:ui-serif;font-size:40px;letter-spacing: -1px;line-height:95%;">Article Recap</h2>

The Axanthic Gene in Crested Geckos produces some stunning hatchlings, (assuming visual axanthic expression). Definitely something for the Crested Gecko enthusiasts and collectors. For those interested in High-end Crested Geckos and Crested Gecko Genetics, the axanthic crested gecko is well worth it's price. If you're just a fan of Crested Geckos, and you aren't serious about lineage and genetics, the price is hard to justify, and it probably isn't the right fit for your next sticky-toed lizard purchase. I love Axanthic crested geckos, and hope to own one someday, but for now it is well outside my price range. To see more about Axanthic Crested Geckos I would definitely go check out Altitude Exotics on instgram, and tell him ReptiKeep sent you (you'll be surprised what he says). He is one of the leading producers of Axanthic Crested Geckos, and Axanthic Lilly White Crested Geckos in the United States, and probably world wide.
